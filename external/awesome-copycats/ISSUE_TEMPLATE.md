Take the following steps:

2. Search [Awesome doc](https://awesomewm.org/doc)
3. Ask [community](https://awesomewm.org/community)

and, if you still don't have an answer, you can ask here.

# If you have an issue

First do

1. search the [Issues section](https://github.com/copycat-killer/awesome-copycats/issues) and
2. try with default Awesome configuration, usually located in `/etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua` or `/usr/local/etc/xdg/awesome/rc.lua`.

If you can't find a solution and your issue doesn't happen with default configuration, then go ahead and provide:

* output of `awesome -v` and `lua -v`
* expected behavior and actual behavior
* steps to reproduce the problem

# If you have a new feature or theme request

Write a detailed description of the desired design, preferably with screenshots or mockups.
